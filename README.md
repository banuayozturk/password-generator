# password-generator

## Deployed Application: https://banuayozturk.github.io/password-generator/
## Description: 
This password generator project is my very first JavaScript program. 

With this project, I aimed to create a password generator with a prompt. User is asked for password lenght and character types prefered and then password written  in the page according to user choice.

Besides creating a project with JavaScript,  this project has been a good practice for me to understand the basic javaScript workflow.
